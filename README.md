## _Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit_

The PSA application was developed by MÃ¡rio H. Moura-Neto and Mateus F. Monteiro, both chemical engineering doctoral students of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte ([PPGEQ/UFRN](https://sigaa.ufrn.br/sigaa/public/programa/portal.jsf?id=106)). The project was supervised by Prof. Dr. [Ivanovitch M. D. Silva](https://github.com/ivanovitchm) ([PPgEEC/UFRN](https://sigaa.ufrn.br/sigaa/public/programa/portal.jsf?id=103)) along the Machine Learning course.
We'll be looking at the efficiency of Nitrogen (N2) separation from a CH4-N2 feed stream by a distillation column. Twelve parameters were monitored in order to determine their influence on N2 separation.
